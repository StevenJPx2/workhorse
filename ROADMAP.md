# Workhorse Roadmap

**North star:** controllable autonomous agents. Autonomy comes not from a
bigger model but from giving a smaller model the right tools and the right
context at the right *stage* of a workflow. Three required properties:
autonomous-but-staged, observable-and-conversational, and a fleet.

Status legend: ✅ shipped · ⏳ planned · 🅿️ tabled

---

## Shipped ✅

- **Staged workflow engine** — Cloudflare Workflow (durable spine) composed
  with `@agwab/pi-workflow` (in-sandbox staging). Coding pipeline:
  `plan → implement → verify → fix`, per-stage tool gating enforced by agent
  frontmatter ceilings.
- **Status model + monitors** — `queued → planning → implementing →
  ready-for-review → in-review → done`. `done`/`terminated` come **only** from
  external signals (PR merged/closed); the agent can never self-complete.
  Webhooks (`/webhooks/:source`) wake parked tickets to run revisions.
- **Plugin architecture** — hard-boundary workspace monorepo: `plugins/*`
  packages (single-word names) implementing `WorkhorsePlugin` from
  `@workhorse/api` (webhook verify/parse/handle, worker routes with
  declared auth tier, lifecycle hooks, optional sandbox `extension.ts`
  auto-discovered by the image build). Plugins depend ONLY on
  `@workhorse/api`; `worker/` is the sole composition point. Live:
  github, slack, browser, knowledge, imgup, tickets.
- **Self-healing** — errored instances re-dispatched as `<ticket>-hN` resuming
  from recorded state (branch/PR/events/memory persist outside the sandbox).
  Heal button + `POST /tickets/:id/heal` + cron sweep (cap 3).
- **PR replies** — every revision posts back on the PR (what changed, or why
  nothing did), with a self-wake guard.
- **Trace archive** — immutable `trace:<ticket>:<run>` (stages, events,
  prompts, analyses, token usage) + per-ticket index. Run-history UI.
- **Adversarial verifier** — fresh-context read-only verifier agent with a
  typed pass/fail verdict; fix stage consumes findings.
- **Evals** — `evals/run.mjs file|report`; per-ticket `model` override;
  corpus × variants mined from traces. First result: haiku matched sonnet 6/6.
- **Magic Context fleet memory** — `@cortexkit/pi-magic-context` baked in;
  `context.db` round-trips KV per repo (`mc:<owner/repo>`); `ctx_search`
  read-only in plan, `+ctx_memory` in implement.
- **Fleet UI** — Nuxt 4 + Nuxt UI 4 (`ui/`): fleet list, ticket detail
  (pipeline card, run history, live compute state), chat, comark markdown.
- **Browser plane** — tiered `browser_fetch` / `browser_screenshot` via the
  Cloudflare `BROWSER` binding, escalating to a pluggable unblocker when a
  credential is configured; scoped `BROWSER_TOKEN`; gated into plan + verify.
- **Screenshot → PR job** — per-ticket `workflow` selector (default `coding`);
  `screenshot-pr` bundle captures a URL, hosts the image (imgup multi-host
  chain with serve-verification: imgbox → pixhost → catbox), embeds it, opens
  a PR.
- **Model fallbacks + delegation** — one stage-restart mechanism, two
  triggers. *Availability*: a stage that dies on the model plane (429 /
  credit exhaustion / expired OAuth — detected from `statusDetail` /
  `failureKind`) re-injects a fresh custodian OAuth token and resumes
  (OAuth-only fleet; two retries, step delay as backoff). *Capability*:
  any stage can set
  `"delegate": true` (+ `delegateReason`) in its control block; the
  orchestrator marks the stage failed, patches the next model up the
  promotion chain (haiku → sonnet → opus, cap 2/run) into the compiled
  plan, and `resumeRun`s — downstream stages re-run via
  `invalidateOnDependencyResume`, upstream artifacts intact. Every
  escalation lands in `esc:<ticket>:<run>` and merges into the trace
  archive, so **evals reveal which stages genuinely need a bigger model**.
- **AI Search fleet knowledge** — every archived run is distilled
  (task, per-stage analyses, verifier verdict, escalations, outcome) and
  indexed into an AI Search instance (`workhorse-fleet`, built-in storage,
  hybrid vector+keyword). Agents get `search_fleet_knowledge` (gated into
  plan + verify) — institutional memory across ALL repos/tickets,
  complementing Magic Context's per-repo working memory; the fleet chat
  answers "why did X fail?" from the same corpus. `POST /knowledge/search`
  (scoped token) + `POST /knowledge/reindex` backfill.
- **Slack bot** — `slack` source plugin (Events API → `/webhooks/slack`,
  signature-verified, 3s-ack via new plugin `handle` override). `@workhorse
  …` mentions route to the fleet-chat agent (file tickets, status, fleet
  knowledge); when it files a ticket the thread maps to it
  (`slack:<channel>:<ts>` ↔ `slack-thread:<ticket>`, mirrors `pr:`).
  Thread replies become mid-run steers (live run) or revision events
  (parked in-review). Outbound: status transitions post into the thread.
  Config: `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` + `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` secrets.
- **Workflow registry (user-configurable workflows)** — workflows are
  USER DATA: KV-registered entries (`workflow:<name>` — spec + agents +
  schemas) uploadable via `PUT /workflows/:name`, validated at upload with
  pi-workflow's own parser (run inside a sandbox). Resolution at prepare:
  repo's `.workhorse/workflows/<name>/` → KV registry → baked seed
  bundles; `POST /workflows/seed` imports the baked bundles (never
  clobbers user entries). New pipelines need no rebuild/redeploy.
- **D1 structured store** — database `workhorse`: `tickets` (status/repo/
  updated indexes), `escalations`, `traces` index, `scripts` (ready for the
  script service). Data layer `worker/src/db.ts`; heal sweep + fleet list
  are single queries now; `GET /tickets?status=` + `GET /repos`;
  `POST /admin/backfill-d1` imported legacy KV (33 tickets, 24 traces).
  Division: D1 records · KV hot small state · R2 blobs · AI Search semantic.
- **R2 blob plane (core)** — bucket `workhorse-blobs`: Magic Context dbs
  (`mc/<owner/repo>.db` — the KV 25 MiB cap that silently dropped memories
  is gone) and trace bodies (`trace/<ticket>/<run>.json`), both with legacy
  KV read fallbacks. Dependency cache still planned (below).
- **Mid-run interception (steering)** — `POST /tickets/:id/steer` (+ steer
  input on the ticket page) queues an operator message; the driving
  workflow picks it up on its next burst, interrupts the current stage via
  pi-workflow's own `stopRun`, appends the steer to the stage's compiled
  prompt (operator instructions take precedence), and `resumeRun`s —
  upstream artifacts intact. Between-stage steers just re-prompt the
  not-yet-started stage. Steers land in the escalation record
  (`trigger: "steer"`) and the trace archive.

- **Jira plugin (first intake source)** — `plugins/jira`: assigned/labeled
  issues file tickets (`Core.fileTicket`; repo from `jira-project:<KEY>` KV
  map or a `repo:` description line); comments on mapped issues steer live
  runs / wake parked ones; ticket lifecycle mirrored onto the issue
  (transitions + PR-link comment); Jira Done/Closed accepted as external
  completion. Webhook auth via `?secret=` (Atlassian can't sign).
- **Script service (agent self-extension)** — `plugins/scripts`:
  `write_script` / `run_script` / `list_scripts` over the D1 `scripts`
  registry (strict validation, repo|global scope, live status gates, args
  as `ARG_<NAME>` env vars); `.workhorse/scripts.toml` seeding at prepare;
  gated into the coding spec (plan lists, implement/fix write, verify runs).
- **ntfy plugin** — hook-only push notifications: PR-up/done/errored/
  terminated + escalation digests, priority-mapped, silent when unset.
- **Paste plugin** — `upload_text`: raw curl-able text hosting
  (paste.rs → 0x0.st → dpaste.org) with serve-back verification.
- **R2 dependency cache** — cold sandboxes restore `node_modules` from
  `depcache/<owner/repo>/<lockfile-sha256>.tar.gz` (content-addressed,
  immutable); sandbox curls `/depcache` with the scoped token; saved after
  successful runs (400 MB cap), restored at prepare + revision re-prepare.
- **Registry UI + vue-flow workflow builder** — `/workflows` list +
  `/workflows/:name` editor: faithful ArtifactGraph canvas (stages=nodes,
  from-edges=connections, computed layout), side-panel stage config, raw
  JSON drawer, save through pi-workflow validation (422 surfaced verbatim),
  seed templates via Save-as; workflow picker on the ticket form; the
  ticket page's live pipeline renders the same graph with per-stage status.
- **Chat-first home** — `/` is one chat box: repo chips (from `/repos`) +
  add-new, per-repo workflow select (create-new → builder), message+repo
  files a ticket / bare message chats with the fleet agent; running-fleet
  strip with View-running/all links. Old form home lives at `/tickets`.

## Planned ⏳ (in priority order)

### `@workhorse/workflow` — the workflow engine
Workhorse owns its workflow engine end to end: `packages/workflow`
carries the full weight of a run — spec compilation, graph routing, the
run state machine, stage execution, control operations — while the
Cloudflare Workflow spine reduces to durability plumbing (durable steps,
retries, parks on `waitForEvent`, wall-clock survival) that calls into
the engine. pi-workflow over own-engine was a real trade, decided on
usage: every Workhorse pipeline is a linear chain of `single` stages —
~30% of pi-workflow's machinery — while the seam between two engines
costs 100%: run state spelunked off disk by inspect scripts,
steering/escalation as surgery on `compiled.json` and internal lease
invariants (fragile against upstream internals changes), and three
sources of truth for "where is this run?".

- **The package**: `@workhorse/workflow`, depending on `@workhorse/api`
  only. Owns the spec format (compatible subset of today's `spec.json`
  — registry, builder, and seeds keep working), the validator behind
  `PUT /workflows`, graph compilation + routing (which stage runs next,
  loop rounds, joins), per-stage prompt assembly (upstream artifact
  digests + control contract epilogue), control-schema validation,
  run lifecycle (dispatch → advance → park → resume → outcome), and
  the control verbs (steer, promote, inject-input, cancel). Sandbox I/O
  sits behind a small `Driver` interface (`exec`/`writeFile`/`readFile`):
  unit tests use a mock driver, the worker provides the
  `@cloudflare/sandbox` implementation.
- **The worker's remaining job**: `TicketWorkflow` maps ticket lifecycle
  onto engine runs — `step.do(() => engine.advance(run))` bursts, park
  when the engine reports `awaiting-input`/`in-review`, deliver the
  outcome (PR, report, artifact), translate statuses for the UI. No
  workflow semantics live in the worker.
- **The stage pattern**: each stage is one bare Pi session in the
  sandbox — `pi -p` with a generated per-stage agent file; Pi agent
  definitions enforce tool ceilings natively, so gating stays
  enforcement. The session writes `analysis.md` + `control.json` to its
  stage dir; the engine validates control against the stage schema,
  computes the digest, and feeds it to dependents. Run state is one
  engine-owned json (`.workflow/<run>/state.json`).
- **Native control operations**: steering kills the session and re-runs
  the stage with the amended prompt; promotion/fallback re-runs with a
  different `--model`; failures carry typed codes
  (`model`/`control`/`session`/`timeout`/`input`).
- **GH-Actions-style workflows**: the spec declares `inputs:`
  (`workflow_dispatch.inputs` pattern, json-render UI at dispatch); a
  stage can request operator input mid-run — the run parks as
  `awaiting-input`, the spine `waitForEvent`s, submission resumes the
  stage with the answers; the terminal stage declares its outcome kind
  (`pr` | `report` | `artifact`).
- **Fan-out**: `foreach` (map a stage over a list artifact — e.g. one
  verify per changed package), `reduce` (fan-in synthesis), and parallel
  `from` joins — CF Workflows runs steps concurrently, so parallel
  stages are parallel sandbox sessions under one run. v1 ships linear +
  loop-until (verify→fix rounds); foreach/reduce land in v2 and create
  the A2A consumer the tabled item waits on.
- **Migration**: the engine lands behind the existing drive-loop
  interface (start/drive/steer/escalate), cuts over per-workflow, then
  pi-workflow leaves the sandbox image and `pi.json` entirely.

### GitHub read tools for agents (`plugins/github/extension.ts`)
The github plugin grows a sandbox half: a small set of READ-ONLY GitHub
tools for agents and fleet chat, cribbing the tool shapes and preset
groupings from
[vercel-labs/github-tools](https://github.com/vercel-labs/github-tools)
(its `code-review`/`repo-explorer`/`ci-ops` presets are a well-chosen
menu) — implemented natively as a Pi extension against the REST API, not
as a dependency (wrong direction for our inbound plugin, wrong agent
framework — AI SDK vs Pi, and dead-weight approval/durability machinery).

- Tools: `gh_pr` (PR details + files + reviews), `gh_ci` (workflow runs
  + failing jobs for a PR/branch), `gh_issue`, `gh_search_code`,
  `gh_commits` (list/get + blame). Auth via the fleet `GITHUB_TOKEN`
  through a scoped worker route (`/github/*` proxy) — the sandbox never
  holds the raw token, same custody model as browser/knowledge.
- Consumers: fleet chat ("summarize the review comments on X's PR",
  "what's failing in CI?"); verify stages (read the actual PR state
  instead of trusting the local diff); revision runs (read the review
  thread directly). Useful across research/audit workflows too.
- Write-level tools are acceptable (commenting, labeling, opening
  issues/PRs, pushing files) — the hard line is SELF-COMPLETING actions:
  merging a PR, closing a PR/issue, or any other operation that
  constitutes an external completion signal stays with the system. The
  /github proxy allowlist encodes that line.

### Semantic index toolkit (`@workhorse/semindex`) + toolpick-style selection
A reusable semantic-search layer over Cloudflare primitives, so building
an index for ANY registry becomes a few lines instead of a bespoke
feature. Inspired by [toolpick](https://github.com/pontusab/toolpick)'s
concept — index everything, rank per query, surface only the top-k.

- **The toolkit**: a workspace package wrapping Workers AI embeddings
  (`@cf/baai/bge-*`) + Vectorize (one index, namespaced per corpus) +
  D1/KV metadata behind a tiny contract:
  `defineIndex({name, toText(item), id(item)})` →
  `{upsert(items), remove(ids), query(text, {topK, filter})}`.
  Registries call `upsert` on write (script registered, workflow saved,
  knowledge doc distilled); consumers call `query`. Embedding+vector
  plumbing, batching, and namespace hygiene live in ONE place. (AI
  Search remains for the heavyweight managed-RAG corpus — fleet
  knowledge docs; the toolkit is for the light structured registries
  where we own chunking and want cheap exact control.)
- **First corpora**: scripts (semantic `list_scripts` — "how do I run
  the e2e suite here?" → the matching script, not the full inventory),
  workflows (picker search + "which workflow fits this task?" in chat),
  tools (the full sandbox tool surface: aft_*, ctx_*, workhorse_*,
  browser/knowledge/imgup/paste/scripts…), and skills when a skill
  registry lands. This fulfills the old L2 ambition (memory #71) of
  semantic search over skills/scripts/tools with fleet-native infra.
- **Toolpick-style per-stage tool selection** (the end game, needs
  pi-workflow cooperation): stage allowlists stay the HARD gate
  (security boundary, unchanged); within the allowed set, rank tools
  against the stage prompt + task via the tools corpus and surface the
  top-k into context, rest callable-but-hidden. pi-workflow owns the
  tool schema list Pi sends — upstream conversation required; until
  then, `find_tool`/`find_script` query tools give agents on-demand
  discovery without any engine change.

### Web search plugin (`plugins/search`) + provider evals
Also evaluate [wigolo](https://github.com/KnockOutEZ/wigolo) as a
provider/self-hosted leg alongside the API providers.

Agents get real AI-grade web search. Today the only web surface is the
browser plane (fetch/screenshot a URL you already know) and
`Lightpanda`-style scraping of search engines is blocked or brittle —
agents need "find me the answer/doc/source" as a first-class tool.

- **Provider comparison first**: survey the AI search APIs — Exa,
  Tavily, Brave Search API, Perplexity Sonar, Jina Reader/Search,
  Firecrawl Search, SerpAPI, You.com — on result quality for agent
  queries (docs lookup, error-message search, library research), snippet
  faithfulness, rate limits, latency, and price per 1k queries.
- **Evals decide, not vibes**: a small eval harness in the repo — a
  fixed query set drawn from real fleet traces (the questions agents
  actually asked the browser plane), graded on retrieval quality
  (did the returned snippets contain the answer?) by an LLM judge.
  Results land in the repo as a report; the winner becomes the default
  provider, the harness stays for re-running when providers ship
  changes.
- **The plugin**: `plugins/search` — worker route `/search` (scoped
  token, provider key custody worker-side, same model as browser) +
  sandbox tool `web_search(query, {depth})` returning ranked
  results with snippets and canonical URLs; compose with
  `browser_fetch` for full-page reads. Provider behind a tiny interface
  so the eval winner is a config choice, not a rewrite; optional
  fallback chain (primary → secondary on 429/5xx, the imgup lesson).
- Stage gating as usual: read-only classification, on in plan/verify
  and research workflows.

### Per-tool evals (`evals/` on evalite)
Every sandbox tool gets an eval suite; [evalite](https://evalite.dev)
(vitest-based, TypeScript-native, fully local, score history + results
UI) is the runner. One eval file per tool — `data` fixtures, `task`
invokes the tool, `scorers` mix deterministic checks with LLM judges
(autoevals): `upload_text` serves the exact bytes back, `web_search`
snippets contain the answer, `search_fleet_knowledge` retrieves the
right trace, `find_script` ranks the right script first, `gh_*` returns
faithful PR state.

The real work is ours, evalite is the chassis:
- **Fixtures from traces**: query/expected sets mined from the trace
  archive — what agents actually asked, what a correct answer looked
  like. Curated once, re-run forever (provider/model changes become
  score diffs, not vibes).
- **Tool-logic export convention**: extension files keep registration
  thin (`pi.registerTool` glue) and export the logic function, so evals
  import and invoke tools outside the sandbox.
- **Selection evals** (later): "given this stage prompt, does the agent
  pick the right tool?" — needs a Pi session harness; evalite scores the
  transcript. Pairs with the semindex top-k tool-visibility work.
- `evals/` is a workspace package; vitest is the repo's test runner
  (tests and evals share one runner — evalite rides vitest), bun stays
  as package manager. CI-runnable, results table committed per run.

### Agent blocks (reusable agent definitions)
Agents become saved, reusable REGISTRY entries — like workflows and
scripts: an agent block = id/name, persona (system prompt), tool
ceiling, optional model/thinking defaults. Stored per-fleet, editable in
the UI, referenced from any workflow stage by name (`stage.agent`).
Seeded from today's baked `sandbox/agents/*.md`. The composability end
game: workflows assemble from blocks — `coding` (implementation-focused)
feeding `screenshot-pr` (screenshot + PR assembly) as two blocks in one
graph, rather than two disjoint workflow bundles.

### Plugin-provided transition states
Ticket transitions (done, accepted, changes-requested — and future
states) are pluggable signals, not core-owned constants: any plugin can
emit a transition via `Core.signalTransition(ticketId, kind, detail)`,
which queues the event and wakes the parked run. GitHub's merge webhook,
Jira's Done transition, the UI's Accept button are all the same
mechanism — and a Slack action button, an ntfy action, or a custom
webhook slot in without touching core. The workflow decides which
signals it honors at which parks; plugins decide how humans produce
them. The combinations are the point.

### PixelRAG feasibility (future session)
Evaluate [PixelRAG](https://github.com/StarTrail-org/PixelRAG) — where
(if anywhere) it beats the current retrieval stack (AI Search for fleet
knowledge, semindex for registries, Magic Context in-sandbox). Outcome:
a short feasibility note; adopt only with a concrete consumer.

### Non-PR outcomes (configurable done states)
Not every fleet run should end in a pull request — some are research
tasks, audits, analyses, or one-off questions whose deliverable is a
REPORT, not a diff. Today the pipeline hard-codes PR-up → in-review →
merged = done; the "Open PR" affordance is baked in.

- **Outcome as a workflow property**: the spec's terminal stage declares
  its outcome kind — `pr` (today's flow), `report` (final artifact
  published as the result: ticket page + Jira/Slack comment + paste URL),
  or `artifact` (files delivered without a PR, e.g. a generated doc
  committed to a branch without review ceremony).
- **Done semantics per outcome**: `pr` keeps external-only completion
  (merge/close). `report`/`artifact` park as `awaiting-acceptance` (a
  sibling of `awaiting-input`) and complete on operator acceptance — an
  explicit "Accept result" action in the UI or a Jira Done transition —
  so the agent still never self-completes. The ticket page's action
  affordance follows the outcome: Open PR / rendered report with
  Accept + Request-changes / branch link with Accept.
- **Rejection = revision**: "Request changes" with a comment feeds the
  existing revision loop — operator feedback plays the role PR reviews
  play for `pr` runs.
- The verify stage still gates: a research workflow's verifier judges the
  report against the task before it's offered for acceptance.
- **Acceptance feeds fleet knowledge**: accepted reports index into AI
  Search as answer documents; rejected-then-revised reports index WITH
  their rejection reasons — research runs compound the way coding runs
  do.
- Builds inside `@workhorse/workflow`: `outcome` is a terminal-stage
  field the engine reads; the spine's deliver step switches on it.

### Workflow input parameters + input-parked runs (json-render)
Two related upgrades to workflows-as-data, GitHub-Actions style:

- **Declared inputs**: a workflow spec declares typed input parameters
  (`inputs: {name, type, description, default, required, options?}` —
  the `workflow_dispatch.inputs` pattern). Triggering one from the UI
  renders those as real input controls (text/select/boolean/number)
  before dispatch; the values land in the task prompt / spec defaults.
  The file-ticket form and chat-first home render them dynamically via
  [vercel-labs/json-render](https://github.com/vercel-labs/json-render)
  (schema-driven UI from JSON — no hand-built form per workflow).
- **Input-parked runs**: a new park state where a RUNNING workflow stops
  and asks the operator for input mid-flight (today's only park is
  in-review). A stage declares an input request (same JSON schema),
  the run parks as `awaiting-input`, the ticket page renders the form
  via json-render, and submission resumes the run with the answers
  injected as a steer/handoff. Generalizes: approve/deny gates, choice
  points ("which of these three approaches?"), credentials-shaped input.
- **Live agent output + a clean ticket page**: the running agent's
  streaming output (current stage's session log) is visible on the
  ticket page as it happens, and `tickets/:id` is redesigned around the
  run — the workflow graph, the live output, and the schema-rendered
  input/acceptance forms presented coherently rather than as stacked
  cards.

### Better Glance integration
The fleet lives on a homelab Glance dashboard today as (at best) a plain
iframe. Make it first-class:

- **Glance widgets over the existing API**: `custom-api` widget configs
  (Glance natively renders remote JSON) for fleet-at-a-glance — running
  tickets with live phase, errored count, last done, PR links. Ship as a
  documented `glance/` snippet folder in the repo (copy into your
  glance.yml).
- **Deep links**: every widget row links into the Nuxt UI ticket page.
- **Compact iframe mode**: a `/embed` route in the UI (header-less,
  dense, dark-aware) purpose-built for iframe embedding in dashboard
  tiles, instead of iframing the full app.

## Tabled 🅿️

### Knowledge attachments (plugin-provided context)
Attaching context to a dispatch or ticket is a PLUGIN capability, not a
core feature: repos, Jira tickets, Slack conversations, PR threads —
each is a "knowledge attachment" a plugin contributes (fetch + render +
prompt-enrichment). The chat-first home's repo chips become one instance
of a general attachment surface; messaging the fleet agent enriches the
prompt by resolving attachments through their plugins. Applies to the
ticket page too (attach more context to a live ticket). A large,
holistic change — design before build.

### Non-chat triggers (cron + mention-fed prompts)
With non-PR outcomes (report) and plugin-provided inputs in place,
triggers generalize beyond chat/API dispatch: cron jobs with a fixed
prompt + workflow + output ("every Monday, produce a Slack report on
X"), Slack mentions feeding the prompt directly, Jira mentions doing the
same. A trigger = source (cron | mention | webhook) + prompt template +
workflow + outcome routing.

### Notification bus (queued operator input)
Operator input from ANY surface (Nuxt UI, PR comments, Slack, Jira, …)
queues in a per-ticket notification bus instead of interrupting
immediately; when the run reaches a park that reads notifications, the
agent acknowledges, collates, replies to each, and the workflow decides
whether to loop back — by design, not by interrupt. Subsumes today's
steer (live interrupt) and revision events (park wake) under one queue
with workflow-declared read points.

### A2A / live agent communication
Graph-mediated handoff already carries typed stage outputs (`control.json` /
`analysis.md` / `refs.json`), `from` data edges, `sourceProjection.include`,
`inputPolicy.requiredReads`, `foreach`/`reduce` fan-out/fan-in, and `dag`
composites. Live peer-to-peer messaging between CONCURRENT subagents has no
consumer today: every Workhorse bundle is a linear pipeline (no
`foreach`/`dag` fan-out), so no two subagents ever run at once. Revisit when
a workflow genuinely fans out — a shared-filesystem mailbox + polling tool,
or an orchestrator-level message bus.

### Rust in Workhorse
The control plane is TypeScript: `WorkflowEntrypoint` and the
`@cloudflare/sandbox` SDK are JS-only contracts, and the code Workhorse owns is
I/O-bound glue (inference runs on Anthropic, builds run in the target repo).
Three entry points would justify Rust: (1) in-sandbox helper binaries baked into
the image (trace collector / diff processor); (2) a self-hosted orchestrator
daemon should the fleet outgrow Cloudflare Workflows; (3) a CLI for
filing/watching tickets.

---

## Future workflow specs

Workflows are user data (see Workflow registry): upload a spec via
`PUT /workflows/:name`, or version one in the target repo under
`.workhorse/workflows/<name>/`. The baked `sandbox/workflows/` bundles
(`coding`, `screenshot-pr`) are seeds — `POST /workflows/seed` imports them
into the registry on a fresh deployment.

---

## Infrastructure constraints

- **Trace mining** — persisted traces feed per-stage optimization: detect
  repeated tool calls, tune prompts and tool sets.
- **Browser hard blocks** — hard-PerimeterX sites (e.g. talbots.com) deny even
  real headed Chrome on a residential IP, so they require a commercial
  unblocker credential on the Tier-2 escalation. Soft/monitor-mode sites pass
  through Tier 1 natively.
- **Image hosting** — no single keyless host is reliable: catbox throttles
  datacenter IPs to 0-byte serves, 0x0.st has uploads disabled. The upload tool
  walks a fallback chain and verifies each URL serves real bytes before
  accepting it. Probe from the sandbox IP before trusting a new host.
